    """Checks if a model is currently deprecated or withdrawn based on its lifecycle entries.

    This function iterates through the lifecycle entries of a model and determines if any entry indicates
    a 'deprecated' or 'withdrawn' status with a start date on or before the current date.

    Args:
        lifecycle (list of dict): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a lifecycle
            event for the model. Each dictionary should have 'id' (string) indicating the event type
            (e.g., 'deprecated', 'withdrawn', 'general_availability') and 'start_date' (string) in
            'YYYY-MM-DD' format indicating when the event became active.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the model is currently deprecated or withdrawn, False otherwise.
